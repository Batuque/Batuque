# Batuque Project

The Batuque Project is an interactive application that combines color detection with drum sound playback. Using real-time video capture, the project plays different drum sounds based on the presence of specific colors detected by the camera.

## üî® Project Features

- **Color Detection**: Identifies specific colors and plays corresponding sounds.
- **Real-Time Sound Playback**: Drum sounds are played instantly upon detecting the correct colors.
- **Graphical User Interface**: Includes a start screen, configuration options, and a menu to start the game.
- **Music Synchronization**: Sounds and visual effects are synchronized with the rhythm of the music.
- **Custom Configuration**: Allows users to adjust screen resolution and sound volume through a settings menu.
- **Visual Feedback**: Overlays images and visual effects to indicate color detection and sound playback.
- **Login and Registration Screen**: Features for creating an account and accessing the application with different user profiles.
- **Interactive Tutorial**: Audio and instructions to guide users in using the system.
- **Test Mode**: Dedicated scripts for testing color detection and audio switching.
