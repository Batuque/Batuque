# Batuque

The Batuque project is an application that uses computer vision to detect colors in real-time through the camera and play percussion instrument sounds based on the detected colors. The graphical interface is managed with the Pygame library, providing an interactive home screen and configuration menus.

## üî® Project Features

- **Color Detection:** Detects specific colors in the camera image using the HSV color space and applies masks to identify these colors.
- **Sound Playback:** Plays percussion instrument sounds when the corresponding color is detected in predefined regions of interest (ROIs).
- **Image Overlay:** Displays transparent images over the detected regions to visually represent the instruments.
- **Graphical Interface:** Provides a home screen with control buttons, a settings menu, and a loading screen.
- **Volume and Resolution Control:** Allows adjusting the music volume and screen resolution through the settings menu.

## ‚úîÔ∏è Techniques and Technologies Used

- **OpenCV:** For video capture and image processing, including color detection and image overlay.
- **Pygame:** For creating the graphical interface, managing events, and playing sounds.
- **Python:** Programming language used to develop the application.
